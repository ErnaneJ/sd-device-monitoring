# Environmental Monitoring Device Project

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the code and documentation for an Environmental Monitoring Device project. The project's primary goal is to create a versatile device that can monitor and display environmental conditions, making it useful in various scenarios. 📊

## Project Components

### 1. 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD)
- This component provides a visual interface for the user.
- Details: [LCD Setup and Code](./src/LCD/) 💻

### 2. DHT22/11 Humidity and Temperature Sensor
- Measures temperature and humidity.
- Provides real-time data for monitoring the environment.
- Details: [DHT Sensor Setup and Code](./src/DHT/) 🌡️💧

### 3. Control Buttons with Interrupts
- These buttons enhance user interaction and navigation.
- The device responds to user input through button presses.
- Integrated with the LCD for easy navigation between different screens. 🔘

### 4. Developer Configuration Modes
- Allows users to configure temperature units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
- Set temperature and humidity thresholds for monitoring.
- Configure the data sampling interval for sensor readings. 🔧
